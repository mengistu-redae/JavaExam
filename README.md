This repository was originally forked from sachinkeshav/JavaExam and made availabele with some modifications and optimizations.

It contains solutions to some common problems that involve manipulation of array. 
The questions are taken from Maharishi (MIU) entrance exam.

The solutions to these array related problems are written in Java programming language but the logic is pretty much same across all the languages.
